Module is a file which contains python functions , global variables etc. It is
nothing but .py file which has python executable code / statement.
So basically they are python scripts that you can import in python

Libraries are a collection of modules.

Packages( Third party libraries ) are libraries which are not pre-installed and need to be downloaded.

The command used to install a package (diretly in command line, no need to
start python) :
( pip install <package_name> )


Also some things about commenting and documenting your file :
"""
    --code written here is the documented code--
"""

#This line is commented
